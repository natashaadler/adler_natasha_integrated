# Flow Yoga Studio

## About

Here at flow we believe in a practice which stretches and strengthens our bodies both physically and mentally. We mindfully move and connect with our breath, reminding us to be mindful and present in our daily tasks. We believe that in practicing we can honor our true authentic selves and except out limitations. Here at flow we donâ€™t want you to go with the flow we want you to be the flow.

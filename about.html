                    <h3>Hatha Yoga</h3>
                    <p>Hatha is a general category that includes most yoga styles. It is an old system that includes the practice of asanas (yoga postures) and pranayama (breathing exercises) which help bring peace to the mind and body. This prepares the body for deeper spiritual practices such as meditation. </p>

                    <h3>Gental Yoga</h3>
                    <p>For beginners, a gentle class is a wonderful alternative to Yoga Basics. The moderate pace creates an accessible environment for students with less yoga experience. Not only is it appropriate for a wide spectrum of practitioners but it does move at a slow and steady pace.  You will work, but at a low-intensity level. </p>

                    <h3>Power Yoga</h3>
                    <p>Power yoga is used to describe a vinyasa-style yoga. It originally closely resembled ashtanga (classical Indian yoga) and was an attempt to make ashtanga more accessible to Western students. It differs, in that it is not a set series of poses, but rather allows the instructor freedom to teach what they want.</p>

                        <p>Claudia has dedicated herself to the practice, study and teaching of yoga since discovering its joys and benefits in 1997 while backpacking throughout Asia, Australia, and parts of Europe. Being a lifelong learner, she has studied with world-renowned instructors, including Jason Crandell, Kia Miller, Shiva Rea, and many others. She creates a safe, non-competitive space for her students to dive beneath the surface of their daily lives to find deeper meaning and inspiration. Her classes offer creative sequences with intentional themes, emphasizing the importance of proper alignment, pranayama breathing techniques, mindfulness, and meditation. Modification and advanced options are made available for new students and experienced yogis so that all can reach their potential.

                            <p>Julio began practicing yoga 11 years ago as a way to heal his body from years of sports injuries and weight lifting. After experiencing positive changes in his own body, he decided to start teaching to help others find healing for their bodies too. He brings the discipline of the Ashtanga Yoga with the freestyle of Vinyasa to his classes. Julio primarily teaches slow flow, combining meditation and pranayama (breathing exercises) into his classes. Further exploration of the medium has taken him on travels throughout Scandinavia, India and Europe, including a three month stay in Italy. Yoga has provided him with new tools to face the lessons in life, and new enthusiasm to explore the unknown. Julio encourages his students to find their flow through breath and focus. It is often said in yoga that you are as young as you keep your mind and spine flexible. Julio cant wait to help you discover your inner flow! </p>

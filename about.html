                    <h3>Hatha Yoga</h3>
                    <p>Hatha is a general category that includes most yoga styles. It is an old system that includes the practice of asanas (yoga postures) and pranayama (breathing exercises) which help bring peace to the mind and body. This prepares the body for deeper spiritual practices such as meditation. </p>

                    <h3>Gental Yoga</h3>
                    <p>For beginners, a gentle class is a wonderful alternative to Yoga Basics. The moderate pace creates an accessible environment for students with less yoga experience. Not only is it appropriate for a wide spectrum of practitioners but it does move at a slow and steady pace.  You will work, but at a low-intensity level. </p>

                    <h3>Power Yoga</h3>
                    <p>Power yoga is used to describe a vinyasa-style yoga. It originally closely resembled ashtanga (classical Indian yoga) and was an attempt to make ashtanga more accessible to Western students. It differs, in that it is not a set series of poses, but rather allows the instructor freedom to teach what they want.</p>
